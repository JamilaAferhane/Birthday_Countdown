# Birthday Countdown Project
This project is a simple HTML page that displays a countdown to your birthday. It includes an `index.html` file, a `script.js` file, a `style.css` file, and an image for the background.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/JamilaAferhane/Birthday_Countdown.git`

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the countdown.

# Usage
To use the birthday countdown, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The page will display a countdown to your next birthday based on the current date and time.

# Customization
If you want to customize the page, you can modify the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the countdown. You can also modify the `script.js` file to change the date of your birthday or add additional functionality.
